Minimal Kiosk Browser is a small and fast web browser based on the webkit engine (same as Midori or Chromium) with support for playing audio and video files (including m3u paylists) and web video (youtube and other websites supported by youtube-dl and HTML5 video) with omxplayer. It also supports opening PDF files directly from the browser (using either mupdf or xpdf) and downloading files of any kind (using wget).
